# MERN Films

Welcome film fans!
This project contains everything you need to
find the perfect movie to add to your Netflix queue.

Don't believe me? [Give it a gander](https://mern-films.herokuapp.com/)

I'm leveraging MongoDB, Node, Express and React... Can you feel the MERN?

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/johndupper/mern-films.git`

`cd mern-films`

`npm install`

Disclaimer: I've been told the database URL is top-secret.
If you happen to have the right one, please:

`touch .env` and define the url as follows:

`MONGO_DB_URL=` (...you know what goes here)

`npm run demo` and enjoy!

Ciao for now,
John Dupper
